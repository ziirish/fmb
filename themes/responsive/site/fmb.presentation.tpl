                            Some projects on which I'm working currently. These projects are mainly "just for fun".

                            The content of this website is quite technical. Sometimes I can write some
                            humor posts, but it's really rare.
                            I like to explain what I do or what I did on various topics from sysadmin
                            things to coder things.

                        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
                        <p>I'm a French system engineer. I'm using GNU/Linux since 2005 
                        (I removed my Windows partition in 2007) and contributing for a 
                        few Open Source projects since 2008. I am also an ice hockey 
                        player since 2011. I'm using this nickname since 2008 when I was
                        in Ireland.
                        <em>Ziirish</em> actually means "The Irish" prononced
                        with the French accent.</p>
